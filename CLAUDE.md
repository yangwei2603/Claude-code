## Getting Started

### Required Configuration

| Config | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | API keys, LLM providers (MiniMax/DeepSeek) |
| `.claude/commands/*.md` | 7 slash commands (spec, plan, build, test, review, code-simplify, ship) |

### Verification

Run `/help` to confirm slash commands are loaded. If commands are missing, check that `.claude/commands/` contains all 7 command files.

### Hooks

Session lifecycle hooks in `.claude/hooks/` and `hooks/`:

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `session-start.sh` | On session start | Initialize workspace context |
| `sdd-cache-pre.sh` | Before SDD skill | Cache preparation |
| `sdd-cache-post.sh` | After SDD skill | Cache refresh |
| `simplify-ignore.sh` | During simplify | Ignore patterns for refactoring |

### Skill Rules

1. **Check for an applicable skill before starting work.** Skills encode processes that prevent common mistakes.
2. **Skills are workflows, not suggestions.** Follow the steps in order. Do not skip verification steps.
3. **Multiple skills can apply.** Sequence them: `spec` → `planning` → `impl` → `test` → `review` → `ship`.
4. **When in doubt, start with a spec.** If the task is non-trivial and there's no spec, begin with `spec-driven-development`.

## Slash Commands

Available after `.claude/commands/` is set up:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/spec` | Define requirements and acceptance criteria |
| `/plan` | Break down implementation into tasks |
| `/build` | Incremental implementation with tests |
| `/test` | Test-driven development workflow |
| `/review` | Code review across five quality axes |
| `/code-simplify` | Identify and remove unnecessary complexity |
| `/ship` | Parallel fan-out review (code + security + test) then launch |

## Agent System

### Reusable Personas

Located at `agents/personas/`:

| Persona | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `code-reviewer` | Code quality review, PR review |
| `security-auditor` | Security vulnerability scanning |
| `test-engineer` | Test strategy, test coverage analysis |

### Orchestration Rules

- **Single perspective** → Call a persona directly
- **Multi-perspective parallel** → `/ship` command (fan-out: code-reviewer + security-auditor + test-engineer → merge)
- **Full pipeline automation** → `agents/orchestration/main.py` (9-agent Python framework)

### Multi-Agent Orchestration (agents/orchestration)

Located at `agents/orchestration/`. A Python-based orchestration framework with 9 specialized agents:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| PM Agent | Requirement analysis, module decomposition |
| Architect Agent | System design, technology selection |
| Task Agent | Task planning and scheduling |
| Dev Agent | Code generation and implementation |
| Test Agent | Test case generation |
| Fix Agent | Bug analysis and repair |
| Review Agent | Code review |
| Deploy Agent | Deployment and release |
| Monitor Agent | System monitoring and alerting |

**Entry point**: `agents/orchestration/main.py`

## Development Workflow

**Closed-loop development**: Plan → Explore → Implement → Review → Simplify

| Phase | Command / Skill | Description |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Define | `/spec` | Requirements, acceptance criteria |
| Plan | `/plan` | Task breakdown and sequencing |
| Explore | Explore Agent | Codebase research, architecture analysis |
| Build | `/build` | Incremental implementation |
| Test | `/test` | Test-driven verification |
| Review | `/review` | Code quality review |
| Simplify | `/code-simplify` | Remove unnecessary complexity |
| Ship | `/ship` | Parallel review + launch |

## Core Operating Behaviors

These apply at all times, regardless of which skill is active:

1. **Surface assumptions** — Before implementing anything non-trivial, state your assumptions explicitly and ask for confirmation.
2. **Manage confusion actively** — When you encounter inconsistencies, STOP. Name the confusion. Ask. Don't guess.
3. **Push back when warranted** — Point out problems directly with concrete downsides. Sycophancy is a failure mode.
4. **Enforce simplicity** — Prefer boring, obvious solutions. Cleverness is expensive.
5. **Maintain scope discipline** — Touch only what you're asked to touch. No unsolicited renovation.
6. **Verify, don't assume** — A task is not complete until verification passes. "Seems right" is never sufficient.

## Karpathy Coding Guidelines (Mandatory Constraint)

> Source: [andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills)
> These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
